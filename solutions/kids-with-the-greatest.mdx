# Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

-----

#### Description: 

There are ```n``` kids with candies. You are given an integer array ```candies```, where each ```candies[i]``` represents the number of candies the $$i^{th}$$ kid has, and an integer ```extraCandies```, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return _a boolean array result of length ```n```, where ```result[i]``` is ```true``` if, after giving the $$i^{th}$$ kid all the ```extraCandies```, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or ```false``` otherwise._

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
```

```txt
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.
```

```txt
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```n == candies.length```
- ```2 <= n <= 100```
- ```1 <= candies[i] <= 100```
- ```1 <= extraCandies <= 50```

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> kidsWithCandies(vector<int>& candies, int extraCandies) {
        int maxi = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<candies.size(); i++) {
            maxi = max(maxi, candies[i]);
        }
        vector<bool>res;
        for (int i=0; i<candies.size(); i++) {
            if (candies[i] + extraCandies >= maxi) {
                res.push_back(true);
            } else {
                res.push_back(false);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- First, we find the maximum number of candies among all the kids.
- Then, we iterate through the array and check if the number of candies of the $$i^{th}$$ kid plus the extra candies is greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies.
- If it is, we push ```true``` to the result array, else we push ```false```.
- Finally, we return the result array.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$ where $$n$$ is the number of kids.
