# Rotate List

-----

#### Description: 

Given the ```head``` of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by ```k``` places.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```

```txt
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
```

#### Constraints: 

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range ```[0, 500]```.
- ```-100 <= Node.val <= 100```
- $$0 <= k <= 2 * 10^9$$

#### Code: 

```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func rotateRight(head *ListNode, k int) *ListNode {
    if head == nil {
        return head
    }
    temp := head
    count := 0
    for temp != nil {
        count++
        temp = temp.Next
    }
    k = k % count
    temp = head 
    for i := 0; i<count - k - 1 ; i++ {
        temp = temp.Next;
    }
    ptr := temp.Next
    if ptr == nil {
        return head
    }
    for ptr.Next != nil {
        ptr = ptr.Next
    }
    ptr.Next = head;
    head = temp.Next;
    temp.Next = nil;
    return head;
}
```

#### Explanation:

- First, we need to find the length of the linked list.
- Then, we need to find the new head of the linked list which will be at the position ```count - k - 1``` from front or ```k``` from the back.
- Then, we need to find the last node of the linked list and connect it to the head of the linked list.
- Finally, we need to break the connection between the new head and the node before it.


#### Complexity Analysis:

- The time complexity for this approach is $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the linked list.
