# Majority Element

-----

#### Description: 

Given an array ```nums``` of size ```n```, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ```⌊n / 2⌋``` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

```txt
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```n == nums.length```
- $$1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4$$
- $$-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9$$

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            mp[nums[i]]++;
            if (mp.at(nums[i]) > n/2) {
                return nums[i];
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem using a hash map to store the frequency of each element in the array.
- We iterate over the array and increment the frequency of the current element in the hash map.
- If the frequency of the current element becomes greater than $$n/2$$, we return the current element as the majority element.
- If no majority element is found, we return 0.



#### Complexity Analysis:

- The time complexity for this approach is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the size of the input array.
