# 3Sum Closest

-----

#### Description: 

Given an integer array ```nums``` of length ```n``` and an integer ```target```, find three integers in ```nums``` such that the sum is closest to ```target```.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

```txt
Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```3 <= nums.length <= 500```
- ```-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000```
- $$-10^4 <= target <= 10^4$$

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        int ans_sum = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<n-2; i++) {
            int l = i+1, r = n-1;
            while (l < r) {
                int value = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r];
                if (ans > abs(value-target)) {
                    ans = abs(value-target);
                    ans_sum = value;
                }
                if (value == target) {
                    return target;
                } else if (value < target) {
                    l++;
                } else {
                    r--;
                }
            }
        };
        return ans_sum;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- First, we sort the array.
- We maintain two variables, ```ans``` and ```ans_sum```, to store the minimum difference and the sum of the three integers, respectively.
- We iterate over the array and for each element, we find the sum of the current element and the two pointers. (same as 3sum problem)
- We update the ```ans``` and ```ans_sum``` if we find a sum that is closer to the target.
- Finally, we return the ```ans_sum``` as the output.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- The **Time complexity** for this approach is $$O(n^2)$$, where ```n``` is the length of the array.
