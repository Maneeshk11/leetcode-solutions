# Reverse Words in a String

-----

#### Description: 

Given an input string ```s```, reverse the order of the words.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in ```s``` will be separated by at least one space.

Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

**Note** that ```s``` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

```txt
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

```txt
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

#### Constraints: 

- $$1 <= s.length <= 10^4$$
- ```s``` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ```' '```.
- There is **at least one** word in ```s```.

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        string res="", temp = "";
        vector<string>words;
        for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != 32){
                temp.push_back(s[i]);
            } else {
                temp != "" ? words.push_back(temp) : void();
                temp = "";
            }
        }
        temp != "" ? words.push_back(temp) : void();
        for (int i=words.size()-1; i>0; i--) {
            res += words[i] + " ";
        }
        res += words[0];
        return res;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We will iterate over the given string and store the words in a vector.
- Then we will iterate over the vector in reverse order and append the words to the result string.
- Finally, we will return the result string.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the length of the given string. We are iterating over the string once and the vector of words once.
