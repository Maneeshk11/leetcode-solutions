# 3Sum

-----

#### Description: 

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets ``` [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]``` such that ```i != j```, ```i != k```, and ```j != k```, and ```nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0```

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
```

```txt
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
```
```txt
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
```

#### Constraints: 

 - ```3 <= nums.length <= 3000```
 - $$-10^2 <= nums[i] <= 10^5$$

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        set<vector<int>> answer;
        for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {
            int l = i+1, r = n-1;
            if (nums[i] > 0) {
                break;
            }
            while (l < r) {
                int value = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r];
                if (value == 0) {
                   answer.insert({nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]});
                    l++;
                    r--;
                    if (nums[i+1] == nums[i]) {
                        i++;
                    }
                } else if (value < 0) {
                    l++;
                } else {
                    r--;
                }
            }
        }
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        for (auto x:answer) {
            result.push_back(x);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- First, we sort the array.
- We iterate over the array and for each element, we find the other two elements such that their sum is equal to the negative of the current element.
- We use two pointers to find the other two elements. We move the left pointer if the sum is less than 0 and move the right pointer if the sum is greater than 0. We get a triplet when the sum is equal to 0.
- We use a set to store the triplets to avoid duplicates.
- We can break the loop if the current element is greater than 0 as all the three elements at this point are greater than "0".
- We return the result as a vector of vectors.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time complexity**: Time complexity for this approach is $$O(n^2)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input array.
