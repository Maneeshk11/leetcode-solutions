# Copy List with Random Pointer

-----

#### Description: 

A linked list of length ```n``` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or ```null```.

Construct a ```deep copy``` of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly ```n``` brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the ```next``` and ```random``` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.**

For example, if there are two nodes ```X``` and ```Y``` in the original list, where ```X.random --> Y```, then for the corresponding two nodes ```x``` and ```y``` in the copied list, ```x.random --> y```.

Return _the head of the copied linked list._

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of ```[val, random_index]``` where:

    ```val```: an integer representing ```Node.val```
    ```random_index```: the index of the node (range from ```0``` to ```n-1```) that the ```random``` pointer points to, or ```null``` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will only be given the ```head``` of the original linked list.


#### Examples:

```txt
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```

```txt
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
```

```txt
Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```0 <= n <= 1000```
- $$-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4$$
- ```Node.random``` is ```null``` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

#### Code: 

```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* random;
    
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        next = NULL;
        random = NULL;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        if (!head) {
            return head;
        }
        unordered_map<Node*, Node*>mp;
        Node *temp=head;
        while (temp) {
            Node *newnode = new Node(temp->val);
            mp[temp] = newnode;
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp = head;
        while (temp) {
            mp[temp]->next = mp[temp->next];
            mp[temp]->random = mp[temp->random];
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        return mp[head];
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem using a hash map. We will iterate over the linked list and create a new node for each node in the linked list. We will store the mapping of the original node to the new node in a hash map.
- In the second iteration, we will iterate over the linked list again and set the next and random pointers of the new nodes using the hash map.
- Finally, we will return the head of the new linked list.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- The time complexity for this approach is $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- The space complexity is also $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the linked list.
