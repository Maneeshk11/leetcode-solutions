# Unique Paths

-----

#### Description: 

There is a robot on an ```m x n``` grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., ```grid[0][0]```). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., ```grid[m - 1][n - 1]```). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers ```m``` and ```n```, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner._

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to $$2 * 10^9$$.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

```txt
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```1 <= m, n <= 100 ```

#### Code: 

```go
func uniquePaths(m int, n int) int {
    if (m == 1 && n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    grid := make([][]int, m)
    for i := range m {
        grid[i] = make([]int, n);
    }

    grid[0][0] = 0;
    for i := 1; i<m; i++ {
        grid[i][0] = 1
    }
    for i:=1; i<n; i++ {
        grid[0][i] = 1
    }
    for i := 1; i<m; i++ {
        for j := 1; j<n; j++ {
            grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j] + grid[i][j-1]
        }
    }
    return grid[m-1][n-1]
}
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array of size $$m \times n$$ and initialize the first row and first column with 1 as there is only 1 way to reach these boxes.
- We can then iterate over the array and calculate the number of ways to reach the current cell by adding the number of ways to reach the cell above it and the number of ways to reach the cell to the left of it.
- Finally, we return the value in the bottom-right cell of the array, which represents the number of unique paths to reach the destination.



#### Complexity Analysis:

- Time complexity: $$O(m \times n)$$ - We iterate over the entire grid of size $$m \times n$$ to calculate the number of unique paths.
