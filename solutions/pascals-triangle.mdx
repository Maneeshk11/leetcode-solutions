# Pascal's Triangle

-----

#### Description: 

Given an integer ```numRows```, return the first numRows of **Pascal's triangle.**

In **Pascal's triangle**, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
```

```txt
Input: numRows = 1
Output: [[1]]
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```1 <= numRows <= 30```

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        res.push_back({1});
        for (int i=1; i<numRows; i++) {
            vector<int> temp = {1};
            for (int j=0; j<i-1; j++) {
                temp.push_back(res[i-1][j] + res[i-1][j+1]);
            }
            temp.push_back(1);
            res.push_back(temp);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We start by pushing the first row of the Pascal's triangle which is always ```[1]```.
- Then we iterate from the second row to the given number of rows.
- For each row, we create a temporary vector and push ```1``` to it.
- Then we iterate from the second element to the second last element of the previous row and push the sum of the current element and the next element of the previous row.
- Finally, we push ```1``` to the temporary vector and push the temporary vector to the result vector.
- We return the result vector.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(numRows^2)$$ as we are iterating over all the rows and for each row, we are iterating over all the elements of the previous row.
