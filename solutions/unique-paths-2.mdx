# Unique Paths II

-----

#### Description: 

You are given an ```m x n``` integer array ```grid```. There is a robot initially located at the t   op-left corner (i.e., ```grid[0][0]```). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., ```grid[m - 1][n - 1]```). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as ```1``` or ```0``` respectively in ```grid```. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner._

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to $$2 * 10^9$$.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

```txt
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```m == obstacleGrid.length```
- ```n == obstacleGrid[i].length```
- ```1 <= m, n <= 100```
-  ```obstacleGrid[i][j]``` is ```0``` or ```1```.

#### Code: 

```go
func uniquePathsWithObstacles(obstacleGrid [][]int) int {
    m := len(obstacleGrid)
    n := len(obstacleGrid[0])
    opt := make([][]int, m)
    for i := range m {
        opt[i] = make([]int, n)
    }
    opt[0][0] = 0
    for i := range n {
        if obstacleGrid[0][i] == 1 {
            opt[0][i] = 0
            break
        } else {
            opt[0][i] = 1
        }
    }
    for i := range m {
        if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 1 {
            opt[i][0] = 0
            break
        } else {
            opt[i][0] = 1
        }
    }
    for i := 1; i<m; i++ {
        for j := 1; j<n; j++ {
            if (obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1) {
                opt[i][j] = opt[i-1][j] + opt[i][j-1]
            } else {
                opt[i][j] = 0
            }
        }
    }
    return opt[m-1][n-1];
}
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem using dynamic programming.
- We can create a 2D array of size $$m \times n$$ and initialize the first row and first column with 1 as there is only 1 way to reach these boxes. If there is a 1 in the obstacle grid, we break the loop and set the value to 0 for all elements that come after in the first row and first column.
- We can then iterate over the array and calculate the number of ways to reach the current cell by adding the number of ways to reach the cell above it and the number of ways to reach the cell to the left of it. If there is an obstacle in the current cell, we set the value to 0.
- Finally, we return the value in the bottom-right cell of the array, which represents the number of unique paths to reach the destination.



#### Complexity Analysis:

- Time complexity: $$O(m \times n)$$ - We iterate over the entire grid of size $$m \times n$$ to calculate the number of unique paths.
