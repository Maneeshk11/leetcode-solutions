# Plus One

-----

#### Description: 

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array ```digits```, where each ```digits[i]``` is the $$i^{th}$$ digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading ```0```'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return the _resulting array of digits_.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
```

```txt
Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
```

```txt
Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```1 <= digits.length <= 100```
- ```0 <= digits[i] <= 9```
- ```digits``` does not contain any leading ```0```'s.

#### Code: 

```go
func plusOne(digits []int) []int {
    for i := len(digits)-1 ; i>=0; i-- {
        digits[i]++;
        if (digits[i] < 10) {
            return digits
        }
        digits[i] = 0; 
    }

    digits = append([]int{1}, digits...)
    return digits
}
```

#### Explanation:

- We start from the last digit of the array and increment it by one.
- If the digit is less than 10, we return the array.
- If the digit is 10, we set it to 0 and move to the next digit.
- If we reach the first digit and it is 10, we append 1 to the beginning of the array and return the array.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the number of digits in the array.
