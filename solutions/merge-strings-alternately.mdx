# Merge Strings Alternately

-----

#### Description: 

You are given two strings ```word1``` and ```word2```. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with ```word1```. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return _the merged string_.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

```txt
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```

```txt
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100```.
- ```word1``` and ```word2``` consist of lowercase English letters.

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string s = "";
        int k = min(word1.length(), word2.length());
        for (int i=0; i<k; i++) {
            s.push_back(word1[i]);
            s.push_back(word2[i]);
        }
        if (word1.length() == word2.length()) {
            return s;
        }
        else if (word1.length() > word2.length()) {
            s += word1.substr(word2.size());
        } else {
            s += word2.substr(word1.size());
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- Initialize an empty string ```s``` to store the merged string.
- Find the minimum length of the two strings ```word1``` and ```word2```.
- Iterate over the minimum length and append the characters from both strings alternatively to the string ```s```.
- If the lengths of the two strings are equal, return the merged string.
- If one string is longer than the other, append the remaining characters of the longer string to the merged string.
- Return the merged string.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: ```O(n)```, where ```n``` is the length of the longer string between ```word1``` and ```word2```.
