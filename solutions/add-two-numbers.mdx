# Add Two Numbers

-----

#### Description: 

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

```txt
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```
```txt
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

#### Constraints: 

 - The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range ```[1, 100]```.
 - ```0 <= Node.val <= 9```
 - It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        int carry = 0;
        ListNode* head = new ListNode((l1->val + l2->val + carry)%10);
        carry = (l1->val + l2->val + carry)/10;
        l1 = l1->next;
        l2 = l2->next;
        ListNode* curr;
        ListNode* prev = head;
        while (l1 != nullptr && l2 != nullptr) {
            curr = new ListNode((l1->val + l2->val + carry)%10);
            carry = (l1->val + l2->val + carry)/10;
            prev->next = curr;
            prev = curr;  
            l1 = l1->next;
            l2 = l2->next;          
        }
        while (l1 != nullptr) {
            curr = new ListNode((l1->val + carry)%10);
            carry = (l1->val + carry)/10;
            prev->next = curr;
            prev = curr;  
            l1 = l1->next;
        }
        while (l2 != nullptr) {
            curr = new ListNode((l2->val + carry)%10);
            carry = (l2->val + carry)/10;
            prev->next = curr;
            prev = curr;  
            l2 = l2->next;
        }
        if (carry == 1) {
            curr = new ListNode(carry);
            prev->next = curr;
        }
        return head;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem by iterating over the two linked lists and adding the corresponding elements.
- We should maintain a carry variable to handle the carry-over from the previous addition.
- We create a new linked list to store the result.
- We iterate over the two linked lists and add the corresponding elements along with the carry.
- If the sum is greater than 9, we update the carry and add the remainder to the new linked list.
- If one of the linked lists is longer than the other, we continue adding the elements of the longer linked list along with the carry.
- If there is a carry left after adding all the elements, we add a new node with the carry to the new linked list.



#### Complexity Analysis:

- The **Time complexity** for this approach is ```O(max(n, m))```, where ```n``` and ```m``` are the lengths of the two linked lists.
- The **Space complexity** is O(max(n, m)), where ```n``` and ```m``` are the lengths of the two linked lists.
