# Path Sum II

-----

#### Description: 

Given the ```root``` of a binary tree and an integer ```targetSum```, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals ```targetSum```. _Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references._

A **root-to-leaf** path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A **leaf** is a node with no children.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]
Explanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22
```

```txt
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: []
```

```txt
Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0
Output: []
```

#### Constraints: 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range ```[0, 5000]```.
- ```-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000```
- ```-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000```

#### Code: 

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void pathSumRecursive(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, vector<vector<int>>& p, vector<int> curr) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return;
        } 
        curr.push_back(root->val);
        if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr && targetSum - root->val == 0) {
            p.push_back(curr);
            return;
        }
        pathSumRecursive(root->left, targetSum - root->val, p, curr);
        pathSumRecursive(root->right, targetSum - root->val, p, curr);
    }
    vector<vector<int>> pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        pathSumRecursive(root, targetSum, res, {});
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem using a recursive approach. 
- We will create a recursive function ```pathSumRecursive``` that will take the current node, the target sum, a vector of vectors to store the paths, and a vector to store the current path.
- We start from the root node and check if the current node is a leaf node and if the sum of the path from the root to the current node is equal to the target sum.
- If the current node is not a leaf node, we recursively check the left and right subtrees with the updated target sum.
- If any of the recursive calls return true, we add the current path to the result vector.
- Finally, we return the result vector containing all the root-to-leaf paths with the target sum.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- The time complexity for this approach is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
