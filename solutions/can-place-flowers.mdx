# Can Place Flowers

-----

#### Description: 

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array ```flowerbed``` containing ```0```'s and ```1```'s, where ```0``` means empty and ```1``` means not empty, and an integer ```n```, return ```true``` _if ```n``` new flowers can be planted in the ```flowerbed``` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and ```false``` otherwise.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

```txt
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

#### Constraints: 

- $$1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10^4$$
- ```flowerbed[i]``` is ```0``` or ```1```.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in ```flowerbed```.
- ```0 <= n <= flowerbed.length```

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        if (flowerbed.size() == 1 && flowerbed[0] == 0) {
            if (n-1 <= 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        for (int i=0; i<flowerbed.size(); i++) {
            if (i == 0) {
                if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && flowerbed[i+1] == 0) {
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    n--;
                    i++;
                }
            } else if (i == flowerbed.size() - 1) {
                if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && flowerbed[i-1] == 0) {
                    n--;
                    i++;
                }
            } else if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && flowerbed[i-1] == 0 && flowerbed[i+1] == 0) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                n--;
                i++;
            }
        }
        if (n  <= 0) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- If the number of flowers to be planted is 0, then we can return true.
- If the flowerbed has only one plot and it is empty, then we can plant a flower if the number of flowers to be planted is less than or equal to 1. The we check if the number of flowers to be planted is less than or equal to 0, then we can return true.
- We iterate over the flowerbed and check if the current plot is empty and the previous and next plots are also empty, then we can plant a flower in the current plot. Then we decrement the number of flowers to be planted and increment the index by 1.
- If the number of flowers to be planted is less than or equal to 0, then we can return true.
- Otherwise, we return false.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the number of plots in the flowerbed.
