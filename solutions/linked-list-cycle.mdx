# Linked List Cycle

-----

#### Description: 

Given ```head```, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the ```next``` pointer. Internally, ```pos``` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. **Note that ```pos``` is not passed as a parameter.**

Return ```true``` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return ```false```.


#### Examples:

```txt
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

```txt
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

```txt
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

#### Constraints: 

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range $$[0, 10^4]$$.
- $$-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5$$
- ```pos``` is ```-1``` or a valid index in the linked-list.

#### Code: 

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (!head || !head->next) {
            return false;
        }
        ListNode *slow=head, *fast=head->next;
        int count = 0;
        while (fast) {
            if (slow == fast) {
                return true;
            }
            if (count%2 == 0) {
                slow = slow->next;
            }
            fast = fast->next;
            count++;
        }
        return false;
    }
};    
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem using the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm.
- We will use two pointers, one slow and one fast.
- The slow pointer will move one step at a time and the fast pointer will move two steps at a time.
- If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
- If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the linked list.
- We will return true if the fast pointer meets the slow pointer and false if the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- The time complexity for this approach is $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the linked list.
