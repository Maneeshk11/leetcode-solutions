# Minimum Path Sum

-----

#### Description: 

Given a ```m x n grid``` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
```

```txt
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```m == grid.length```
- ```n == grid[i].length```
- ```1 <= m, n <= 200```
- ```0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200```

#### Code: 

```go
func minPathSum(grid [][]int) int {
    m := len(grid)
    n := len(grid[0])
    dp := make([][] int, m)
    for i := range m {
        dp[i] = make([]int, n)
    }
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    for i:=1; i<m; i++ {
        dp[i][0] = grid[i][0] + dp[i-1][0]
    }
    for i:=1; i<n; i++ {
        dp[0][i] = grid[0][i] + dp[0][i-1]
    }
    for i:=1; i<m; i++ {
        for j:=1; j<n; j++ {
            dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j])
        }
    }
    return dp[m-1][n-1]
}
```

#### Explanation:

- We create a 2D array `dp` of size `m x n` to store the minimum path sum at each cell.
- We initialize the first cell of the `dp` array with the value of the first cell of the grid.
- We then initialize the first column and the first row of the `dp` array with the sum of the previous cell and the current cell in the grid.
- We then iterate over the entire grid and calculate the minimum path sum at each cell by taking the minimum of the sum of the cell above and the cell to the left of the current cell in the grid.
- Finally, we return the value at the last cell of the `dp` array which will be the minimum path sum from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.


#### Complexity Analysis:

- The time complexity of this approach is `O(m*n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
