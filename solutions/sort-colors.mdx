# Sort Colors

-----

#### Description: 

Given an array ```nums``` with ```n``` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers ```0```, ```1```, and ```2``` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

```txt
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```n == nums.length```
- ```1 <= n <= 300```
- ```nums[i]``` is either ```0```, ```1```, or ```2```.

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.size()-1;
        while (mid <= high) {
            if (nums[mid] == 0) {
                nums[low] = 0;
                if (low < mid) {
                    nums[mid] = 1;
                }
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } else {
                nums[mid] = nums[high];
                nums[high] = 2;
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- Implemented an approach called Dutch National Flag Algorithm. The idea is to use three pointers to divide the array into three parts.
- The three pointers are ```low```, ```mid```, and ```high```. 
- The ```low``` pointer is used to keep track of the next position where we can place the next ```0```.
- The ```mid``` pointer is used to iterate through the array.
- The ```high``` pointer is used to keep track of the next position where we can place the next ```2```.
- We iterate through the array and check the value at the ```mid``` pointer.
- If the value is ```0```, we swap the value at the ```low``` pointer with the value at the ```mid``` pointer and increment both the ```low``` and ```mid``` pointers.
- If the value is ```1```, we simply increment the ```mid``` pointer.
- If the value is ```2```, we swap the value at the ```mid``` pointer with the value at the ```high``` pointer and decrement the ```high``` pointer.
- We continue this process until the ```mid``` pointer is less than or equal to the ```high``` pointer.
- At the end of the process, the array will be sorted in place.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- Time complexity: ```O(n)``` where ```n``` is the number of elements in the array.
