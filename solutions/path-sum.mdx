# Path Sum

-----

#### Description: 

Given the ```root``` of a binary tree and an integer ```targetSum```, return ```true``` if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals ```targetSum```.

A leaf is a node with no children.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
```

```txt
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
```

```txt
Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
Output: false
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
```

#### Constraints: 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range ```[0, 5000]```.
- ```-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000```
- ```-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000```

#### Code: 

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr && targetSum - root->val == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        return hasPathSum(root->left, targetSum - root->val) || hasPathSum(root->right, targetSum - root->val);
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem using a recursive approach. 
- We start from the root node and check if the current node is a leaf node and if the sum of the path from the root to the current node is equal to the target sum.
- If the current node is not a leaf node, we recursively check the left and right subtrees with the updated target sum.
- If any of the recursive calls return true, we return true.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
