# Product of Array Except Self

-----

#### Description: 

Given an integer array ```nums```, _return an array ```answer``` such that ```answer[i]``` is equal to the product of all the elements of ```nums``` except ```nums[i]```_.

The product of any prefix or suffix of ```nums``` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in ```O(n)``` time and without using the division operation.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

```txt
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

#### Constraints: 

- $$2 <= nums.length <= 10^5$$
- ```-30 <= nums[i] <= 30```
- The product of any prefix or suffix of ```nums``` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int>prefix, suffix;
        int n = nums.size();
        int temp = 1;
        prefix.push_back(1);
        suffix.push_back(1);
        for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {
            temp *= nums[i-1];
            prefix.push_back(temp);
        }
        temp = 1;
        for (int i=n-2; i>=0; i--) {
            temp *= nums[i+1];
            suffix.push_back(temp);
        }
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            nums[i] = suffix[n-1-i] * prefix[i];
        }
        return nums;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem by using two vectors, one for the prefix and one for the suffix.
- We will iterate over the given array and calculate the prefix product of the array elements.
- Then we will iterate over the array in reverse order and calculate the suffix product of the array elements.
- Finally, we will iterate over the array and calculate the product of the prefix and suffix elements at each index and store in the array itself.
- We will return the updated array.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the length of the given array. We are iterating over the array three times.
