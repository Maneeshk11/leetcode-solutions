# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

-----

#### Description: 

You are given an array ```prices``` where ```prices[i]``` is the price of a given stock on the $$i^{th}$$ day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the _maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction._ If you cannot achieve any profit, return ```0```.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

```txt
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

#### Constraints: 

- $$1 <= prices.length <= 10^5$$
- $$0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4$$

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxi = 0, res = 0;
        for (int i=prices.size()-1; i>=0; i--) {
            maxi = max(maxi, prices[i]);
            res = max(res, maxi-prices[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem by iterating the array from the end and keeping track of the maximum value we have seen so far.
- We can then calculate the profit by subtracting the current value from the maximum value we have seen so far.
- We can then update the result by taking the maximum of the current result and the profit we just calculated.
- Finally, we return the result.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the number of elements in the array.
