# Remove Nth Node From End of List

-----

#### Description: 

Given the ```head``` of a linked list, remove the $$n^{th}$$ node from the end of the list and return its head.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

```txt
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

```txt
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

```

#### Constraints: 

- The number of nodes in the list is ```sz```.
- ```1 <= sz <= 30```
- ```0 <= Node.val <= 100```
- ```1 <= n <= sz```

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode* temp = head;
        ListNode* slow;
        ListNode* prev;
        int count = 0;
        while (temp != nullptr && count < n) {
            temp = temp->next;
            count++;
        }
        slow = head;
        prev = head;
        while (temp != nullptr) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow->next;   
            temp = temp->next;         
        }
        if (slow == head) {
            return head->next;
        }
        prev->next = slow->next;
        return head;    
    }
};

```

#### Explanation:

- We use two pointers, ```slow``` and ```temp```, to find the $$n^{th}$$ node from the end.
- We first move the ```temp``` pointer by $$n$$ steps.
- Then we move both pointers until ```temp``` reaches the end of the list.
- At this point, ```slow``` will be pointing to the $$n^{th}$$ node from the end.
- We then remove this node by updating the ```next``` pointer of the previous node stored in a ```prev``` pointer moved simultaneously with ```slow``` pointer. 

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(N)$$, where ```N``` is the number of nodes in the list.
