# Max Consecutive Ones

-----

#### Description: 

Given a binary array ```nums```, return _the maximum number of consecutive ```1```'s in the array._

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

```txt
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```

#### Constraints: 

- $$1 <= nums.length <= 10^5$$
- ```nums[i]``` is either ```0``` or ```1```.

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxi = 0;
        int loc_max = 0;
        for (auto x:nums) {
            if (x == 1) {
                loc_max++;
            } else {
                maxi = max(maxi, loc_max);
                loc_max = 0;
            }
        }
        maxi = max(maxi, loc_max);
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem by iterating over the array and keeping track of the maximum number of consecutive ones.
- We will maintain two variables, ```maxi``` and ```loc_max```, where ```maxi``` will store the maximum number of consecutive ones found so far, and ```loc_max``` will store the number of consecutive ones found in the current sequence.
- We will iterate over the array and increment ```loc_max``` whenever we encounter a ```1```. If we encounter a ```0```, we will update ```maxi``` with the maximum of ```maxi``` and ```loc_max```, and reset ```loc_max``` to ```0```.
- Finally, we will update ```maxi``` with the maximum of ```maxi``` and ```loc_max``` and return ```maxi``` as the result.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the length of the array.
