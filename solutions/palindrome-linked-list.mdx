# Palindrome Linked List

-----

#### Description: 

Given the ```head``` of a singly linked list, return ```true``` _if it is a ```palindrome``` or ```false``` otherwise_.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```

```txt
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

#### Constraints: 

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range $$[1, 10^5]$$.
- ```0 <= Node.val <= 9```

#### Code: 

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode *p1 = head, *p2 = head;
        int count = 0;
        while (p2->next) {
            if (count%2 == 1) {
                p1 = p1->next;
            }
            p2 = p2->next;
            count++;
        }
        if (p1 == p2) {
            return true;
        }
        p1 = p1->next;
        ListNode *curr=p1, *fut, *prev=nullptr;
        while (curr) {
            fut = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = fut;
        }
        p1 = prev;
        while (head && p1) {
            if (head->val != p1->val) {
                return false;
            }
            head = head->next;
            p1 = p1->next; 
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We can solve this problem by reversing the second half of the linked list and then comparing the first half with the reversed second half.
- To find the middle of the linked list, we can use the two-pointer technique.
- We can use the slow and fast pointers to find the middle of the linked list.
- Once we find the middle of the linked list, we can reverse the second half of the linked list.
- Finally, we can compare the first half with the reversed second half of the linked list.
- If the first half is equal to the reversed second half, then the linked list is a palindrome.
- Otherwise, it is not a palindrome.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- The time complexity for this approach is $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- The space complexity for this approach is $$O(1)$$.
