# Majority Element II

-----

#### Description: 

Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ```⌊ n/3 ⌋``` times.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```

```txt
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
```

```txt
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

#### Constraints: 

- ```n == nums.length```
- $$1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4$$
- $$-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9$$

#### Code: 

**_Solution Using A hash-map_**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            mp[nums[i]]++;
        }
        vector<int> result;
        for (auto x: mp) {
            if (x.second > n/3) {
                result.push_back(x.first);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

**_Solution using_ Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm _(O(1) Space Complexity)_**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ct1 = 0; int ct2 = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        int elem1 = 0; int elem2 = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++) {
            if (ct1 == 0 && nums[i] != elem2) {
                ct1 = 1;
                elem1 = nums[i];
            } else if (ct2 == 0 && nums[i] != elem1) {
                elem2 = nums[i];
                ct2 = 1;
            } else if (nums[i] == elem1) {
                ct1++;
            } else if (nums[i] == elem2) {
                ct2++;
            } else {
                ct1--;
                ct2--;
            }
        }
        ct1 = 0, ct2 = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == elem1) {
                ct1++;
            } else if (nums[i] == elem2) {
                ct2++;
            }
        }
        if (ct1 > n/3 && ct2 > n/3) {
            return {elem1, elem2}; 
        } else if (ct1 > n/3) {
            return {elem1};
        } else if (ct2 > n/3) {
            return {elem2};
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

1. For approach using hash-map:
    - We can solve this problem using a hash map to store the frequency of each element in the array.
    - We iterate over the array and increment the frequency of the current element in the hash map.
    - We then iterate of the hash map and check if the frequency of any element is greater than $$n/3$$, we add that element to the result vector.
    - Finally, we return the result vector containing all elements that appear more than $$n/3$$ times.

2. For approach using Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:
    - The main intuition is that there can be at most two elements that appear more than $$n/3$$ times in the array.
    - We maintain two counters and two elements. We iterate over the array and update the counters and elements based on the current element.
    - If the element is the same as one of the counters, we increment the counter.
    - If the element is different from both counters, we decrement both counters.
    - If any of the counters becomes zero, we update the corresponding element to the current element.
    - After the first pass, we count the occurrences of the two elements in the array.
    - If the count of any element is greater than $$n/3$$, we add it to the result vector.




#### Complexity Analysis:

- The time complexity for both the approaches is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the size of the input array.
- The space complexity for the hash-map approach is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the size of the input array.
- The space complexity for the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm approach is $$O(1)$$.
