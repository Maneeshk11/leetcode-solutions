# Palindrome Number

-----

#### Description: 

Given an integer ```x```, return ```true``` if ```x``` is a ```palindrome```, and ```false``` otherwise.

#### Examples:

```txt
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

```txt
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
```txt
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

#### Constraints: 

 - $$-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1$$

#### Code: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        string s = to_string(x);
        int i = 0, j = s.length()-1;
        while (i<j) {
            if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                i++;
                j--;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:

- We first check if the number is negative. If it is, we return ```false``` as negative numbers cannot be palindromes.
- We then convert the integer to a string.
- We use two pointers, one at the start of the string and the other at the end of the string.
- We compare the characters at the two pointers. If they are equal, we move the pointers towards each other.
- If the characters are not equal, we return ```false```.
- If the pointers meet, we return ```true```.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$ where $$n$$ is the number of digits in the integer.
